## GETTING UP AND RUNNING WITH ABSOLUTELY/EZ 
1. CLONE THIS REPO.
2. Create a `public/` folder next the the Vagrantfile.
3. Run `Vagrant up`.

## GETTING EZ CODE BASE
1. change directories into your newly created public directory `cd public`.
2. Clone the ez codebase into the public directory without any parent folder. ` git clone https://github.com/ezsystems/ezplatform.git .`. Please note the space and the period at the end of this commend.
3. run `composer install` inside of the public directory. This may take a minute to complete and you will most likely be asked to put in some configuration values. The values should be as follows: ![alt text][config]
4. run `php -d memory_limit=-1 app/console ezplatform:install --env prod clean` to exe the EZ install command.
